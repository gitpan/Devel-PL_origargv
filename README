NAME
    Devel::PL_origargv - access to the Perl interpreter's argv

SYNOPSIS
            my @PL_origargv = Devel::PL_origargv->get;

DESCRIPTION
    If Perl is run with the following command:

            perl -w -Ilib yourscript.pl arg1 arg2

    Then @ARGV will be pre-populated with "arg1" and "arg2", and $0 will
    reflect the name of your script, but there's no way to access "-w" or
    "-Ilib".

    This module provides one class method that returns Perl's original argv
    array as a list.

    "get"
        Returns argv as a list of strings. If called in scalar context,
        returns argc (i.e. the count of argv).
